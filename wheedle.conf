# === POLLERS ===
# Each section below (except [DEFAULT]) names a poller / poller pair, and is aimed at one GitHub
# Actions workflow which produces artifacts, and which optionally may need to be triggered by a
# Commit Poller because the source repository is not the same as the build repository. There may be
# an arbitrary number of pollers. Each poller will inherit values present in the [DEFAULT] section
# provided they are not explicitly changed within the poller section.
# Each poller describes a mandatory Artifact Poller, and an optional Commit Poller which is needed
# if the source repository is not the same as the build repository and the build repository needs
# to be triggered by commits in the source repository.
# Each poller has the following keys (and which may be specified in the DEFAULT section above):
#
# --- Artifact Poller ---
# build_repo_owner: [REQUIRED] Owner of GitHub repository which builds the artifacts through
#                   GitHub Actions.
# build_repo_name:  [REQUIRED] Name of GitHub repository which builds the artifacts through
#                   GitHub Actions.
# bodega_url:       [REQUIRED] URL for the Bodega artifact storage service.
# stagger_url:      [REQUIRED] URL for the Stagger artifact tagging service.
# artifact_poller_polling_interval_secs: [REQUIRED] Polling interval for the artifact poller in
#                   seconds. Value must be an integer.
# error_polling_interval_secs: [REQUIRED] Polling interval for the artifact poller in seconds when
#                   there is a connection error to the Bodega / Stagger services. This allows for a
#                   much shorter time between attempts to connect than a standard polling interval
#                   (polling_interval_secs). Value must be an integer.
# source_branch:    [REQUIRED] Git branch being built and polled for new commits.
# stagger_tag:      [REQUIRED] Stagger tag used for tagging artifacts.
# build_artifact_name_list: [REQUIRED] String representing a JSON list of strings containing names
#                   of artifacts to be downloaded and processed if found. Wildcards are allowed.
# last_build_hash_artifact_name: Name of the last commit hash JSON file to be written and read from
#                   the data directory. By default, it is "commit-hash.<poller-name>.json".
# artifact_poller_data_file_name: Name of the artifact poller persistence file in the data
#                   directory. By default, it is "artifact-poller.<poller-name>.json".
# build_download_limit: Limits the number of previous successful and completed GitHub Actions
#                   workflows to download that have not been previously seen. This prevents a large
#                   number of older artifacts from being downloaded into Bodega which may not be
#                   useful. If not set, then all available workflows which succeeded and which
#                   contain artifacts will be downloaded in build order up to an internal limit of
#                   50 workflows.
#
# --- Commit Poller ---
# NOTE: ALL-OR-NOTHING: For a valid Commit Poller configuration, ALL three of "source_repo_owner",
#       "source_repo_name" and "commit_poller_polling_interval_secs" must be present together. If
#       only one or two are present, a configuration error will result. If none are present, then no
#       Commit Poller will be started for this poller group.
# source_repo_owner: [ALL-OR-NOTHING] Owner of GitHub repository which contains the source code
#                  checked out into the Build Repository and which are built to create artifacts.
# source_repo_name: [ALL-OR-NOTHING] Name of GitHub repository which contains the source code
#                  checked out into the Build Repository and which are built to create artifacts.
# commit_poller_polling_interval_secs: [ALL-OR-NOTHING] Polling interval for the commit poller in
#                   seconds. Value must be an integer.
# trigger_dry_run: Disable actual build trigger, but will log a trigger as a dry run. This is to
#                  conserve GitHub resources while testing / debugging.
#                  Valid values: 'true', 'yes', '1', and are case-insensitive. Any value not in this
#                  list, or the lack of this key will be considered false/off, and actual GitHub
#                  Actions builds will be initiated.
# commit_poller_data_file_name: Name of the commit poller persistence file in the data directory. By
#                  default, it is "commit-poller.<poller-name>.json".

# [DEFAULT] Optional section which sets default values for all following poller sections which
# describe specific pollers. If not set here, then some of these must be set in the individual
# poller sections which follow. Values set here can also be overridden in the following poller
# sections. See POLLERS below for a description of individual keys/values that may be placed here.
# NOTE: This section must be placed *above* the poller sections.
